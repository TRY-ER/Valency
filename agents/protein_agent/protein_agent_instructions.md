# Protein Agent: Instructions for Use

You are interacting with the `ProteinAgent`, an AI assistant designed to handle a wide range of protein-related tasks, including exploration, searching, and information retrieval. It achieves this by intelligently dispatching requests to specialized sub-agents: the `alphafold_agent` (for UniProt and AlphaFold data) and the `rcsb_agent` (for PDB experimental data).

**Understanding the Landscape: UniProt vs. PDB**

*   **UniProt (Universal Protein Resource):** Focuses on protein **sequences and functional information**. Think of it as a comprehensive encyclopedia for each protein, detailing its amino acid sequence, what it does, where it\'s located in a cell, its variants, and links to relevant literature. UniProt uses **UniProt Accession Keys** (e.g., P12345, Q5VSL9) as unique identifiers.
    *   The `alphafold_agent` primarily interacts with UniProt data and the AlphaFold database, which provides **predicted 3D structures** for proteins.
*   **PDB (Protein Data Bank):** Focuses on **experimentally determined 3D structures** of biological macromolecules. Think of it as a library of 3D blueprints for proteins and nucleic acids. PDB uses **PDB IDs** (e.g., 1A2B, 4HHB) as unique identifiers for these structural entries.
    *   The `rcsb_agent` interacts with the RCSB PDB to search and retrieve information about these experimental structures.

**How the `ProteinAgent` Works**

The `ProteinAgent` analyzes your request to determine the most appropriate sub-agent (or combination of sub-agents) to fulfill it.

1.  **Query Analysis:** It identifies keywords, identifiers (UniProt vs. PDB), and the type of information you\'re seeking.
2.  **Sub-Agent Dispatch:**
    *   Requests involving UniProt accessions, protein functions, sequences, or AlphaFold *predicted* structures are typically routed to the `alphafold_agent`.
    *   Requests involving PDB IDs, *experimental* 3D structures, structure similarity searches, or specific experimental details are typically routed to the `rcsb_agent`.
3.  **Bridging UniProt and PDB:** For queries requiring information from both domains (e.g., "What are the experimental structures for the protein with UniProt ID X?"), the `ProteinAgent` can coordinate calls between the sub-agents. For instance, it might first use the `alphafold_agent` to get PDB IDs linked to a UniProt accession, and then use the `rcsb_agent` to fetch details for those PDB IDs.
4.  **Response Synthesis:** It compiles the information from the sub-agent(s) into a coherent answer.

**Sub-Agent: `alphafold_agent`**

**General Guidelines for Interacting with `ProteinAgent`:**

*   **Be Specific:** Clearly state whether you are interested in UniProt/AlphaFold information (sequences, functions, predictions) or PDB information (experimental structures).
*   **Provide Identifiers:** Use UniProt Accessions for `alphafold_agent` queries and PDB IDs for `rcsb_agent` queries when known.
*   **Clarify Your Needs:** If you need to bridge information (e.g., from a UniProt ID to its PDB structures), state this clearly. The `ProteinAgent` will attempt to coordinate.
*   **Iterate if Necessary:** Complex queries might require a few steps. The `ProteinAgent` can guide you or perform these steps sequentially.

By understanding the roles of the `alphafold_agent` and `rcsb_agent`, you can effectively leverage the `ProteinAgent` for your protein research needs.

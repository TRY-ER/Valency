## Usage

### Basic Search Process
1. **Enter a CID**: Type a valid PubChem Compound Identifier (e.g., "2244" for aspirin)
2. **Set Threshold** (Optional): Adjust similarity threshold if needed (default 90% works well)
3. **Click Search Similar**: Execute the similarity search
4. **Review Results**: Browse through similar compounds in the results grid
5. **Select Compounds**: Click on any compound card to view detailed information

### Input Requirements
- **CID Format**: Positive integers only (e.g., 2244, 5281804, 441243)
- **Threshold Range**: Integer values between 0-100 (higher = more similar compounds only)
- **Connection**: Active internet connection for PubChem API access

## What You'll See

### Search Interface
- Clean input field with placeholder text "Enter PubChem CID (e.g., 2244)"
- Search type dropdown (currently showing "PubChem CID")
- Real-time validation with checkmarks (‚úì) for valid inputs or warning icons for invalid formats
- "Search Similar" button that activates when input is valid

### During Search
- Loading animation with "üîç Searching for similar molecules..." message
- Progress indication while the system queries PubChem and retrieves compound data

### Results Display
- **Main Compound Panel**: Comprehensive data viewer showing:
  - Compound name and identifiers
  - Molecular formula and weight
  - SMILES notation
  - Physical and chemical properties
  - Cross-references to other databases

- **Similar Molecules Grid**: Card-based layout showing:
  - Compound CID numbers
  - Similarity percentages (e.g., "94.2% similar")
  - Compound names (truncated if long)
  - 2D structure images
  - Selection indicators for the active compound

### Error Handling
- **Invalid CID**: "Invalid CID format. Must be a positive integer (e.g., 2244, 5281804)."
- **No Results**: "No similar molecules found for CID 'X' with similarity threshold Y%"
- **API Errors**: Clear messages explaining connection or data retrieval issues

# BRICS SMILES Generator Documentation
---

## Overview
---

The **BRICS Generator** tool enables users to generate novel molecular structures using the Breaking Retrosynthetically Interesting Chemical Substructures (BRICS) algorithm. The tool takes SMILES strings as input and generates hypothetical molecules by recombining molecular fragments.

## Features
---
- **Batch Input**: Accepts multiple SMILES strings via text file upload
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion status
- **File Preview**: Preview panel to verify uploaded SMILES strings
- **Results Panel**: Interactive output display showing generated molecules
- **Export Options**: Download generated structures or reset the process

### Tool Sections
---
1. **Progress Section**
   - Progress bar showing completed steps
   - Current step indication
   - Overall process status

2. **Input Section**
   - File upload interface
   - SMILES preview panel
   - File validation feedback

3. **Output Section**
   - Generated molecules display
   - Download results button
   - Reset operation button
   - Step-by-step process details

## Usage
---
1. Prepare a text file containing SMILES strings (one per line)
2. Upload the file through the interface
3. Verify the SMILES strings in the preview panel
4. Monitor generation progress
5. Download or copy the generated molecules

## Example
---
Input file format example:

```
CCO
CC(=O)O
C1=CC=CC=C1
```

The tool will process these SMILES strings and generate new molecules by:
1. Breaking them into fragments
2. Recombining fragments in novel ways
3. Generating valid molecular structures

### Use Cases
---
This tool is particularly useful when:
- Exploring chemical space around known molecules
- Generating libraries of potential drug candidates
- Discovering new molecular scaffolds
- Expanding existing molecular databases
